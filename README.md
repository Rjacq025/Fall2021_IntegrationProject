# Fall 2021 Integration Project

I am Richardson Jacques and this repository is an integration project for my COP 3003 course at FGCU, otherwise known as Programming II. 
I developed this project independently, but had a lot of use from resources from school as well as advice from my professor, teaching assistants, and fellow classmates.
This project is being started at October 10, 2021 and will/did end on December 15, 2021. At this point in this course I still feel like I'm below-average to moderate in terms of proficiency,
but I hope working on this project will give me the experience I need to overcome those doubts. 
I am working on this assignment at Florida Gulf Coast University (and also at home of course).
